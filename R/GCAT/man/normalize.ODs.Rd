\title{Normalize OD readings for an entire array of well objects}
\usage{
normalize.ODs(well.array, normalize.method = "default", blank.value = NULL,
  start.index = 2, add.constant = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{well.array}{an array of well objects.}

\item{normalize.method}{see Details}

\item{blank.value}{user can enter a blank OD measurement for uninoculated wells. if NULL, defaults to the value of the first OD measurement of each well.}

\item{start.index}{which timepoint should be used as the first one after inoculation (defaults to the 2th one)}

\item{add.constant}{add a numeric constant to all timepoints in all wells.}
}
\description{
Normalize OD readings for an entire array of well objects
}
\details{
Note: This function does not write any new OD values to the well objects in the array - it only
  fills the "norm" slot of each well object in the array with a value that will be subtracted
  from all OD measurements when returning data from the wells using the function <data.from> (see well.class.R)
  For "average.layout" the function instead of filling "norm" slot writes a list "averagedTimestamp" in screen.data
  This averagedTimestamp is a list of average of only Empty wells as defined in layout file for each timestamp

   These functions make use of <raw.data> which simply returns the raw time and OD of a well (also see well.class.R)

 note this is the only normalization function that acts on an entire array instead of an individual well.

 normalize.method settings:
 \describe{
 \item{default}{subtracts the blank OD (either specified by <blank.value> or taken from the first timepoint as default)
 of each well from all timepoints in that well}
 \item{average.blank}{subtracts the mean of all first OD timepoints on a plate from all timepoints in all wells on that plate}
 \item{average.first}{takes the mean of the difference between the OD of the specified <start> timepoint and the first timepoint of all wells on a plate
                    and subtracts this value from all timepoints in all wells on that plate}
 \item{average.layout}{Takes an average of all ODs at each timestamp taking into consideration only "Empty" wells as defined in layout file
                    It then stores the list of average timestamps as averagedTimestamp in screen.data of every well}
 \item{anything else}{do nothing}
 }
