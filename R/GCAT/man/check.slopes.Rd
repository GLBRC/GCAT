\title{Use slope estimates to check growth curves for tanking and OD jumps #}
\usage{
check.slopes(input.well, check.start = 22, fall.cutoff = -0.0025,
  remove.jumps = F, jump.multipliers = -c(15, 500, 10), tank.cutoff = 1,
  tank.limit = 6, silent = T, draw = T)
}
\description{
Use slope estimates to check growth curves for tanking and OD jumps #
}
\details{
Uses the functions <data.from> and <well.name> (see well.class.R) 
  
 Fills the "curve.par" slot in the well with the starting index of tanking (NA if none is found)
 
 Changed default values to parameters to account for settling

 @param input.well object of class \code{well} to check the slopes for 
 @param remove.jumps should the program remove OD jumps? default F (just report them) - 
                  should be set to T if data contains distinct jumps in OD that need to be eliminated 
                  otherwise, this might be too stringent and will result in loss of data.  
 @param check.start which timepoint should checking for jumps and tanking start at? this is included because early timepoints can be unstable.
 @param fall.cutoff what downward slope should constitute a fall in OD? 
 @param jump.multipliers multipliers of fall.cutoff that determine whether a curve jumps up or down (see methods 1 and 2, below)
 @param tank.limit how many timepoints in a row can have falling slopes until the curve is marked as tanking?
 @param tank.cutoff what proportion of the maximum OD can the curve go below until it is considered tanking?
 @param silent output to R console?
 @param draw plot growth curve with curve checking details?
